# 🚀 Deployment Fix Guide

The build failure has been fixed! Here's what was wrong and how it's now resolved.

## ❌ **What Was Wrong**

The deployment was failing because:

1. **TypeScript Compilation Issue**: `tsc` wasn't found during Docker build
2. **Postinstall Script**: Was trying to build during `npm ci --only=production`
3. **Missing Dev Dependencies**: TypeScript needs dev dependencies to compile

## ✅ **What's Fixed**

### 1. **Updated Dockerfile**
```dockerfile
# Install ALL dependencies (including dev dependencies for TypeScript)
RUN npm ci

# Build the application (TypeScript needs dev dependencies)
RUN npm run build

# Remove dev dependencies after build to reduce image size
RUN npm prune --production
```

### 2. **Removed Postinstall Script**
- Removed `"postinstall": "npm run build"` from package.json
- Prevents build attempts during dependency installation

### 3. **Simple Deployment Option**
- `deploy-simple.js` - Pure JavaScript, no TypeScript compilation needed
- Works immediately on any platform

## 🚀 **Deployment Options**

### **Option 1: Railway (Recommended)**
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Railway will use `npm run start:simple` (no TypeScript compilation)
3. Should deploy successfully now!

### **Option 2: Docker**
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t elevenlabs-mcp .

# Run locally
docker run -p 3000:3000 elevenlabs-mcp

# Or use docker-compose
docker-compose up -d
```

### **Option 3: Direct Deployment**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build TypeScript
npm run build

# Start server
npm run start:elevenlabs
```

## 🎯 **Current Status**

- ✅ **TypeScript Development**: `npm run dev:elevenlabs`
- ✅ **Simple Deployment**: `npm run start:simple`
- ✅ **Docker Build**: Fixed TypeScript compilation
- ✅ **Railway**: Uses simple deployment

## 🔄 **Development vs Production**

### **Development (TypeScript)**
```bash
npm run dev:elevenlabs
```
- Full TypeScript support
- Hot reloading
- Type safety

### **Production (JavaScript)**
```bash
npm run start:simple
```
- No compilation needed
- Faster startup
- Universal compatibility

## 🎉 **Next Steps**

1. **Commit and push** your changes
2. **Redeploy** on Railway - should work now!
3. **Get your URL** from Railway dashboard
4. **Configure in ElevenLabs**: `https://your-app.railway.app/mcp`

The deployment should now succeed without any TypeScript compilation issues! 🎯
